  Ever asked for help? Yes we all do. Sometimes due to financial issues people ask the government to help them on twitter. Sounds convienent, but it is not as many people ask for help. These tweets are gone missing from inundated timelines and often not seen.

  After running the code, the files are processed in a NLP analyser, I have used monkeylearn for this. This model works flawlessly, but do remember that it is a protoype and it is always learning.
